Welcome to find an easter egg :egg:! The robot :robot: exists indeed, not
only for the demonstration of [New people](/README/#new-people) and
[New news](/README/#new-news).
It is also a github account belonging to out team although it is an
organization account. so we create a page for it.
Is is reasonable, isn't it? 🤣

BTW, it is not only one easter egg. Find more!
